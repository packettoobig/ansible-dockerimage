## Diff with original debian
We just `pip3 install ansible` in addition to [the changes in the original image](https://github.com/pilbbq/debian-custom-dockerimage).
We also install some basic python modules.

## How to use
TODO<br/>
You will of course need docker to be installed. Please refer to [https://get.docker.com/](https://get.docker.com/) for information on this subject.

## Misc
Image is built everytime there is a commit to this repo.<br/>
